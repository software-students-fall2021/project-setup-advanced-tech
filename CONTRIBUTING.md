# Guide to Contributing

### Team Norms

* The Slack Channel created for the group (Weet-group) on the Agile Software Engineering workspace will be the primary point of documented communication for the group. Any actions that require a response have to communicated there along with an @person_name so that everyone knows that a response is required. 
* Meetings will be conducted using zoom. Every meeting must end with a set of next steps for everyone on the team. 
* Everyone has an agreed upon set of softwares to use for assignments and work to be completed. 
* If anyone is facing issues, potential delays in submissions, potential absence on meetings please give an update to the team on Slack as soon as possible. The earlier everyone knows about such things the better, as we will be better equpiied to help out and make sure the team stays on track. 
* Language - Everyone agrees to use language on Slack and on calls that is respectable, inclusive and professional. Please bring to the team's attention ASAP (on Slack or on zoom) if there is anything that makes you uncomfortable or if you'd like anything to change. 

### How and what to contribute

* Sprint planning and standup meetings will outline every individual team member's work for the next 'x' days. 
* If there is any collaboration on work/coding that is needed, additional developer meetings will be set during planning or standup. 
* Our local environment for Github is set already and all team members have joined.
