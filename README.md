# Product Vision Statement

### Vision
Weet is a mobile application that helps users with dietary restrictions (allergies, voluntary restrictions, etc.) find restaurants that cater to their needs. 

##### Theme 1 - Creating an account and listing restrictions

All these feature(s) are needed - 
* As a new user, I want to create a username and password, so that I can create a personal profile on the app and only have to enter preferences once. 
* As a user, I want to enter my dietary restrictions, so that I can enter the ingredients I want to avoid once once. 
* As a user, I want to be able to edit my dietary restrictions, so that I can reflect the changes I want to make in the app. 

##### Theme 2 - Search restaurants based on dietary restrictions and additional filters

These feature(s) are needed - 
* As a user, I want to search restaurants, so that I can find a place to eat that has menu items that caters to my needs. 
* As a user, I want to apply basic filters, so that I can find a restaurant that has menu items that I can eat and is within a certain radius of distance/in a certain area. 

These feature(s) are nice to have - 
* As a useer, I want to have additional filters for search criteria (price, Google/grubhub rating), cuisine, etc.), so that I can further personalize my experience. 

##### Theme 3 - Restaurant display page

These feature(s) are needed - 
* As a user, I want to see the certain detials of the restaurant (name, menu items that I can eat, Google/Grubhub rating, address)

These feature(s) are nice to have - 
* As a user, I want to see additional details for the restaurant for convenience (link to Grubhub, Uber Eats, postmates for delivery, restaurant's contact information, copy of the whole menu for my friends).

##### Theme 4 - Contact us and support

These feature(s) are needed - 
* As a user, I want to be able to contact support (for the app), so that I can get help navigating the website and ask questions I may have. 
* Disclaimer page - To stave off liability in case we have the wrong/outdated information from restaurants.

The project idea came about as an observation of the activity around us. A lot of our friends and family were making choices to go dairy, free, vegetarian, vegan or were allergic to certain ingredients in food. It is always an uncomfortable position when you get to a restaurant and realize that there is nothing in the restaurant for you to eat. All of this could be avoided if there was a way to check the restaurant's menu (in more detail that what is available online) to make sure that there a couple of choices for you. This is also helpful if you're trying to home delivery - instead of calling the people at the restaurant you can be sure through our application.
